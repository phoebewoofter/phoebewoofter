👋 Hi, I’m **@phoebewoofter**
- 🎮 I’m interested in *gamification* for educational purposes (currenly mapping out a game to help employees better understand their benefits during open enrollment).
- 🌱 I’m learning `JavaScript` and `C#`.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate yet, but hopefully will once I have a more solid foundation.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can easily find me on Twitter/X. No hate speech or spam tolerated.
- 😄 Pronouns: *they/them*
- ⛷️ Fun fact: I skate ski competitively (pretend pro haha).
